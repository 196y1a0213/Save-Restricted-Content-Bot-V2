<summary><b>‚ö†Ô∏è Must Do: Secure Your Sensitive Variables</b></summary>

**Do not expose sensitive variables (e.g., `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `BOT_TOKEN`) on GitHub. Use environment variables to keep them secure.**

### Configuring Variables Securely:

- **On VPS or Local Machine:**
  - Use a text editor to edit `config.py`:
    ```bash
    nano config.py
    ```
  - Alternatively, export as environment variables:
    ```bash
    export API_ID=your_api_id
    export API_HASH=your_api_hash
    export BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
    ```

- **For Cloud Platforms (Heroku, Railway, etc.):**
  - Set environment variables directly in your platform‚Äôs dashboard.

- **Using `.env` File:**
  - Create a `.env` file and add your credentials:
    ```
    API_ID=your_api_id
    API_HASH=your_api_hash
    BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
    ```
  - Make sure to add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub.

### **Why This is Important?**
Your credentials can be stolen if pushed to a public repository. Always keep them secure by using environment variables or local configuration files.
