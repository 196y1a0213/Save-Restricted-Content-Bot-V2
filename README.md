### **‚ö†Ô∏è Must Do: Configure Sensitive Variables Securely**

**Do not edit sensitive variables (e.g., `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `BOT_TOKEN`, etc.) directly in `config.py` or any file in the repository on GitHub. Doing so can expose your credentials publicly, leading to security risks.**

### **How to Configure Variables Safely:**

1. **For VPS or Local Machine:**
   - Use a text editor like `nano` to edit the `config.py` file directly on your system:
     ```bash
     nano config.py
     ```
   - Alternatively, export your variables as environment variables:
     ```bash
     export API_ID=your_api_id
     export API_HASH=your_api_hash
     export BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
     ```

2. **For Cloud Deployment (e.g., Heroku, Railway):**
   - Set the variables as **Environment Variables** in the platform's settings.

3. **Using `.env` File:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your variables:
     ```
     API_ID=your_api_id
     API_HASH=your_api_hash
     BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
     etc
     ```
   - Make sure to exclude `.env` from version control by adding it to `.gitignore`.

### **Why This is Important?**
Your credentials can be stolen if pushed to a public repository. Always keep them secure by using environment variables or local configuration files.

## Important Note

**Note**: Changing the terms and commands doesn't magically make you a developer. Real development involves understanding the code, writing new functionalities, and debugging issues, not just renaming things. If only it were that easy!
